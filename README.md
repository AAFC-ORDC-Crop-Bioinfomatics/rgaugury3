Welcome to the RGAugury project.
This project aims to develop a sophisticated informatics tools for large scale of resistance gene analogs prediction, include major group of RGA, such as NBS encoding genes, receptor like protein and receptor like protein kinase. It’s thus named as RGA augury or RGAugury standalone pipeline. At the meantime, we also provided a friendly web-based user interface for those who have less computer skills but are interested for instant RGA verification.

We sincerely this tool can significantly benefit your resistance gene study.
