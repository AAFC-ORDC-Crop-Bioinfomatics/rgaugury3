Either re-compile the program as (e.g.)

cc -O2 -I. -o ncoils-osf ncoils.c read_matrix.c -lm

or use the exectuables (ncoils-osf, ncoils-irix) given.

Move the executables to a central bin directory and re-name
as appropriate.

You then need to set an environment variable $COILSDIR to this directory
so that matrices can be seen.
